# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement POST Endpoint for Message Submission
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a POST endpoint at hi.new/{slug} to accept structured JSON data.
# Details:
The POST handler in app/[slug]/route.ts has been created with Zod validation using ContactFormSchema. The handler successfully fetches the Link and its active DeliveryOptions. Next steps include implementing the actual delivery logic for email (via Resend) and webhook POSTs, along with robust error handling and retry mechanisms for failed deliveries.

# Test Strategy:
Test endpoint with valid and invalid payloads. Verify validation error responses for malformed data. Test successful message processing flow. Implement tests for delivery mechanisms and error recovery scenarios.
